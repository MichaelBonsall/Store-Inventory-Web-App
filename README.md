# Store-Inventory-Web-App

A batch-order system that allows users to seamlessly add items from a store's inventory via a Flask API to a React Native web app. When the user initiates the batch process, the application organizes the items to optimize the picking route, minimizing the distance between items on the shelves and enhancing efficiency. This is done using a graph and a shortest path algorithm.

The API is written in Python, and all frontend logic is written in TypeScript.
